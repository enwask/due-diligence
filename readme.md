# Due Diligence

Due Diligence is your AI-powered shopping helper. Originally developed for the Knight Hacks 2023 hackathon.

This web application allows you to search for a type of product and gives you a digestible comparison of resulting
products and their specifications. You can also save products to your own personal list for later viewing and share your
list with others, or browse through your comparison history if you forgot to save a comparison result.

Sponsored products and ads are filtered out on our end, giving you organic product results that you can trust. We scrape
Google Shopping for product data and use large language models to extract the most important information, separating
concrete specifications from all the noise.
