# Due Diligence

Due Diligence is your AI-powered shopping helper, developed for the Knight Hacks 2023 hackathon with Flask, Google
Cloud Services and the Microsoft Semantic Kernel.

This web application allows you to search for a type of product and gives you a digestible comparison of resulting
products and their specifications. You can also save products to your own personal list for later viewing and share your
list with others, or browse through your comparison history if you forgot to save a comparison result.
