# Due Diligence

Due Diligence is your AI-powered shopping helper, originally developed in 36 hours for the Knight Hacks 2023 hackathon.

This web application allows you to search for a type of product and gives you a digestible comparison of resulting
products and their specifications. You can also save products to your own personal list for later viewing, or share
product lists and comparison with others.

Sponsored products and ads are filtered out on our end, giving you organic product results that you can trust. We search
product data from the retailer of your choice, including Best Buy, Ebay, and Etsy (more coming soon). Product data is
compiled and run through our AI model to extract the most important information, separating concrete specifications
from marketing fluff and miscellaneous noise. This allows you to make the most informed decision possible from our
detailed comparison results.
